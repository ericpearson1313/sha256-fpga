Simulatio is awkward.
Need to put test bench in dialog box.
and select the UUT as the top level design, and then run sim.


Biggest thing is re-running a sim.

To Add waves and then re-run do: (no compile)

add wave _uut/*
restart -f
run -all


Change a file (turn off read only to edit in sim window), need to re-run do

do blaster_run_msim_rtl_verilog.do
add wave _uut/*
restart -f
run -all
